Description: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data
    sets by Boggy et al. (2008) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0012355>. This package
    provides a dilution series for one PCR target: a random sequence that
    minimizes secondary structure and off-target primer binding. The data set
    is a six-point, ten-fold dilution series.
    For each concentration there are two replicates. Each amplification curve
    is 40 cycles long. Original raw data file:
